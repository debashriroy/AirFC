# Implementation of complexPyTorch for AirCNN project

This repository is to generate the trained model to validate over the air computation for AirCNN project. 

## Run

To run this code where we are using noise to train the model: `python main_with_noise.py --hidden_elements 16`

To run this code where we are not using noise to train the model: `python main_no_noise.py --hidden_elements 16`

## Dataset
We use MNIST dataset for the training and evaluation.



## Acknowledgments

We use the open source code published in: https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/complexPyTorch
